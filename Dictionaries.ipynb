    "    with the smallest example you can find. You can either edit the\n",
    "    files themselves, or (better) modify the program so it reads only\n",
    "    the first ``n`` lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If there is an error, you can reduce ``n`` to the smallest\n",
    "    value that manifests the error, and then increase it gradually as\n",
    "    you find and correct errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Check summaries and types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Instead of printing and checking the entire dataset, consider\n",

    "    a dictionary or the total of a list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",

    "    the type of a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write self-checks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sometimes you can write code to check for errors automatically. For\n",
    "    example, if you are computing the average of a list of numbers, you\n",
    "    could check that the result is not greater than the largest element\n",
    "    in the list or less than the smallest. This is called a “sanity\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Pretty print the output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Formatting debugging output can make it easier to spot an error. We\n",
    "    saw an example in [Debugging](Fruitful Functions.ipynb#factdebug). The ``pprint``\n",
