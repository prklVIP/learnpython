    "## Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Careless use of lists (and other mutable objects) can lead to long hours of debugging. Here are some common pitfalls and ways to avoid them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Don’t forget that most list methods modify the argument and return\n",
    "    ``None``. This is the opposite of the string methods, which\n",
    "    return a new string and leave the original alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you are used to writing string code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "        word = word.strip()\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is tempting to write list code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "        t = t.sort()           # WRONG!\n",
    "\n",
    "    Because ``sort`` returns ``None``, the next\n",
    "    operation you perform with ``t`` is likely to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Before using list methods and operators, you should read the\n",
    "    documentation carefully and then test them in interactive mode. The\n",
    "    methods and operators that lists share with other sequences (like\n",
    "    strings) are documented at\n",
    "    <http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq>. The\n",
    "    methods and operators that only apply to mutable sequences are\n",
    "    documented at\n",
    "    <http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable>.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Pick an idiom and stick with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Part of the problem with lists is that there are too many ways to do\n",
    "    things. For example, to remove an element from a list, you can use\n",
    "    ``pop``, ``remove``, ``del``, or even a\n",
    "    slice assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To add an element, you can use the ``append`` method or the\n",
    "    ``+`` operator. Assuming that ``t`` is a list and\n",
    "    ``x`` is a list element, these are right:\n",
    "\n",
    "        t.append(x)\n",
    "        t = t + [x]\n",
    "\n",
    "    And these are wrong:\n",
    "\n",
    "        t.append([x])          # WRONG!\n",
    "        t = t.append(x)        # WRONG!\n",
    "        t + [x]                # WRONG!\n",
    "        t = t + x              # WRONG!\n",
    "\n",
    "    Try out each of these examples in interactive mode to make sure you\n",
    "    understand what they do. Notice that only the last one causes a\n",
    "    runtime error; the other three are legal, but they do the wrong\n",
    "    thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Make copies to avoid aliasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you want to use a method like ``sort`` that modifies the\n",
    "    argument, but you need to keep the original list as well, you can\n",
    "    make a copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "        orig = t[:]\n",
    "        t.sort()\n",

    "    In this example you could also use the built-in function\n",
    "    ``sorted``, which returns a new, sorted list and leaves the\n",
    "    original alone. But in that case you should avoid using\n",
